<!-- - Motion and Sensing: move the robot and measure its distance from the landmarks
- Noise: simulate the noise and add to the measurements
- Particle Filters: randomly and uniformly spread particles throughout the map
- Importance Weight: evaluate the importance weight of each particle
- Resampling: resample the particles
- Error: generate an error value to check the overall quality of the solution. This will enable us to identify how close the particles are to the robot.
- Graphing: plot the position of the robot and the particles at each iteration of the MCL algorithm -->
